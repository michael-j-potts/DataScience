This is an example of using Tableau to create a visual chart that can be used to display and investigate data from large datasets.

Using the World Development Indicators dataset, I created a project visually evaluating the correlation between health expenditure and life expectancy.
This mapping allows us to view life expectancy and health expenditure in multiple ways. Further we can filter our data based on region, a subset of countries,
a specificied income expenditure range or a specific year range.
